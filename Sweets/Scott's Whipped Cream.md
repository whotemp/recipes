## Ingredients
- 1 pint heavy whipping cream
- 2 Tbsp vanilla

## Instructions

- Chill a metal bowl and the whipping prongs (if using an electric mixer) for 2-3 hours
- Place heavy whipping cream in the chilled bowl
- Add vanilla
- Whip aggressively (preferably with an electric mixer) until stiff (I.e., when you take out the blades, the cream stands up)

That's it! :-))) The key is not to add sugar, buy high quality cream, and buy high quality vanilla -- the latter is expensive, but worth it!!!
