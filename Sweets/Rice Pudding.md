### Ingredients
1.5 cups water
0.75 cups uncooked white rice
2 cups milk
0.33 cups sugar
0.25 tsp salt
1 egg
1 Tbsp butter
0.5 tsp vanilla

### Instructions
1. Pour water into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat; stir in rice. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
2. Combine cooked rice, 1 ½ cups milk, sugar, and salt in a clean saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until thick and creamy, about 15 minutes.
3. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk, beaten egg; cook 2 minutes more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla until combined.
