## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 4 cups cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes
- 1/3 cups fresh basil
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1–2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, to taste

## Instructions
1. Heat oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.
2. Add in the tomatoes and stir to combine with the garlic. Cover the pan and continue to cook, stopping to stir the mixture occasionally, until all of the tomatoes have burst and released their juices to form a sauce, about 6-8 minutes. Continue to simmer the mixture uncovered for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until it reaches your desired consistency. Add water if mixture dries out. (Note that the spread will thicken a bit as it cools.)
3. Reduce heat to low. Add in the balsamic, plus any sweetener and/or herbs (if using), and stir until combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper, as needed.
4. Serve warm with your favorite crusty bread.
