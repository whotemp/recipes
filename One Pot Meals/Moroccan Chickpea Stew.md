### Ingredients
- 1.5 cups dry chickpeas
- 4 cups liquid
**Aromatics**
- 1 large yellow onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 oz tomato paste
- 0.5 cup dried apricot (substitude prunes or raisins)
- 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice
**Spices**
- 3 tsp ginger
- 1.5 tsp tumeric
- 1.5 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- <1 tsp cumin
- black pepper
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
**Vegetables**
- 1 bulb fennel
- chard/kale/leafy greens
- 3 carrots
- 4 small yellow potatoes (or 3 yukon gold)


### Instructions

Prep: Soak chickpeas overnight

1. Heat oil in instant pot over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until limp, a few minutes.
2. Add garlic, ginger, salt, turmeric, paprika, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper and cayenne and sauté until they release their fragrance, about 2 minutes.
3. Add tomato paste and sauté for another minute, until darkened but not burned. (If tomato paste looks too dark too quickly, lower heat.)
4. Add fennel, chard stems, carrot and turnip/potatoes and continue to sauté until vegetables start to soften, about 20 minutes?
5. Add soaked chickpeas, 4.5 cups of stock/water.
6. Cook on high pressure for 15 minutes.
7. Release steam, add dried fruit
8. Simmer for 5 minutes, add lemon juice and greens
9. Salt if needed.


Stovetop version:
Simmer chickpeas for 1.5-2 hours
Add dried fruit 30 min before done
Add greens 5 min before done



### Notes
With rice in instant pot:
1.25 cups brown rice
7.5 cups liquid total (2x the chickpeas and rice)
need to increase spices, tastes bland

Another way for very large batches is to cook chickpeas in instant pot, then cook everything else together in the stock pot
